YOFO: You Only Focus Once

YOFO is a script for Magic Lantern that allows you to use your lens' internal focusing motor to
achieve precise and repeatable focus on infinity.

The short idea is: you move your lens to hard stop beyond infinity, count how many steps it takes
your focusing motor to get to infinity and save this value. After that, when you are in the field,
you can achieve perfect focus in just a few simple steps:

1. Move your lens to infinity
2. Turn on AF
2. Goto to YOFO menu and activate pre-set position
3. Turn off AF
4. ?
5. Profit!
